<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project
As of August 2022, the Zulu nation has a new king. South Africa has a population of about 60 million people, with Zulu people being 10-12 million of this population (representing 16%-20% of total population). King Misuzulu is the 9th Zulu king after Shaka kaSenzangakhona. 

For most people in the Zulu kingdom, and South Africa at large, King Misuzulu's coronation was a once in a lifetime event. The ascension of a king in the kingdom has almost always been accompanied by contestation over the rightful heir to the throne. The royal family would have internal dialogues to try and mediate in the midst of the conflict that at times threatened to destabilize the royal home, and by extension, the nation. And so it was the case yet again. Simakade kaZwelithini, Misuzulu's brother, was the other heir-apparent after the passing of King Zwelithini, their father. Ultimately, Misuzulu was found to be the rightful heir.

The purpose of this project was to try and gauge people's sentiment's around the coronation of Misuzulu and how they felt about his brother Simakade. 

"Why does it matter whether you know what people think around this?" you may ask. With the history of how succession battles have turned out in the past when it comes to the Zulu throne, paying attention to these sentiments can help us ascertain whether there will be a peaceful ascension to the throne or whether our governmental leaders may need to take pre-emptive action and reduce tensions in the royal home.

## :compass: Roadmap

There has been a follow-up event to this one where the government handed over a certificate of recognition to the new king. I may have to create another sentiment analysis project covering that particular event.
